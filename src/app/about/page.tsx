                Two Leaves shown in the logo of the living treasure Depict two
                extreme states of one`&apos;`s mind. One leaf is shown as
                totally dry with only skeleton left, depicting a dry state of
                mind, whereas the other leaf is fully green and full of life.
                Now, the dry state of mind means a mind without love,
                care,hospitality, concern and simplicity. A person possessing
                dominating, adamant attitudes is always depressed, confused and
                destructive in habits. So this kind of personality is of no use
                to the society, except the hope that transformation is possible
                with proper nurturing and care.One thing is very clear that this
                dry-looking leaf was not born dry, rather it was fresh looking,
                fully green, very pleasing, attractive and full of life at the
                time of birth. But with the passage of time, onslaughts of
                surroundings and environment it shed off from the tree which had
                to take care of its well-being in every way, irrespective of
                whether the leaf is thankful or thankless, agreeing or
                disagreeing, surrendering or not before the supremacy of the
                tree. But now once broken from the secured system, the leaf is
                sucked out of its beauty, charm, freshness and life And in a
                matter of time it loses its identity forever and gets
                accumulated with the dust and dirt of the ground. And once
                broken-off there is no way it could be rejoined with the Creator
                - the tree. But, fortunately for the human mind, there is a
                hope, there is a chance, a reunion is possible, a transformation
                is possible, if one decides to shed off one`&apos;`s heavy
                weight of egoism, dominating attitudes, anger, etc. And
                surrendering before the master of this universe i.e. the system
                under which this universe is working for millions of years and
                will continue in the same way.
